# 🌑 TEDDY-XMD

**A self-hosted WhatsApp multi-device bot built on [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) — 370 commands, text-only menus, Docker-ready.**

</div>

---

## Features

- **370 commands / 148 aliases** in 17 categories, loaded by a fault-tolerant plugin loader (one broken file never stops the bot; duplicates and alias clashes are skipped and reported).
- **Music** — `.play <song>` searches with the Wolvarex music API, downloads the audio and sends it with title, artist, duration and thumbnail.
- **AI** — `.flux`, `.imagine`, `.groqai`, `.gpt4`, `.gptdirect`, `.llamachat`, `.translate`.
- **Fun** — jokes, riddles, trivia, truth/dare, roasts, pickup/flirt lines, quotes, would-you-rather, fun facts (API first, built-in offline lists as fallback).
- **Downloads / search / tools** — Instagram, TikTok, YouTube audio, video search, website screenshots, weather, image hosting (imgbb / catbox).
- **Group & admin tooling**, welcome/goodbye, anti-spam/link/delete/view-once, automation, sudo list.
- **Text-only redesigned menus** — 6 views (public, private, group, owner, admin, user) × 8 layouts, permission-aware and compact.
- **Security-minded defaults** — API key only from the environment, SSRF guard on every URL, credential files unreadable by `.cat/.ls/.download`, `.eval` and `.update` disabled until you enable them, global output redaction.
- **Deploy anywhere** — Docker, Docker Compose, Fly.io, Koyeb, Render, Pterodactyl panels, plain Node.

## Command categories

| Category | Cmds | Category | Cmds |
|---|---|---|---|
| ADMIN | 40 | MEDIA | 7 |
| AI | 9 | OWNER | 39 |
| AUTOMATION | 8 | SUDO | 4 |
| BOT SETTINGS | 24 | TOOLS | 23 |
| CONVERTER | 7 | USER | 11 |
| DEV | 21 | DOWNLOAD | 5 |
| FUN | 77 | SEARCH | 3 |
| GROUP | 32 | UTILITY | 50 |
| | | MENU STYLE | 10 |

Send `.menu` in WhatsApp. `.menu list` = category index · `.menu ai` = one category · `.menu owner|admin|group|user|public|private` = a specific view (you can only open views you're entitled to).

## Requirements

- Node.js **20+** (22 works)
- `ffmpeg` on the host (stickers, video conversion, and the image-processing fallback used by `.setbotpp`)
- A WhatsApp account for the bot and a **Wolvarex API key** for the API-backed commands

## Installation

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> QUEEN-AKUMA-V4 && cd QUEEN-AKUMA-V4
npm install
cp .env.example .env      # then edit .env
npm start
```

`npm start` runs `sessions.js` — a single deployment, no `SESSION_ID` needed. It opens a web pairing page on `PORT` (default `3000`): open it, enter a WhatsApp number, get a pairing code. Every number paired this way runs as its own independent session from the same deployment (multi-session, like a hosting panel) — add more any time by pairing another number on the same page, or by sending `.linkme <phone>` from an already-connected session. `SESSION_ID` still works for a single legacy account (see below) if you prefer that over pairing.

## Configuration

Everything is configured through environment variables (a local `.env` file is read automatically; real environment variables always win). **`.env` is git-ignored — never commit it.**

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `WOLVAREX_API_KEY` | Key for every Wolvarex-backed command | *(unset → those commands are hidden from menus)* |
| `WOLVAREX_BASE_URL` | API base URL | `https://apix.wolvarex.com/api` |
| `API_TIMEOUT_MS` / `DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_MS` / `API_RETRIES` | Request tuning | `25000` / `90000` / `1` |
| `SESSION_ID` | Legacy: session string for automatic single-account login (skip the pairing page for that one account) | – |
| `MAX_SESSIONS` | Cap on concurrent paired sessions (`sessions.js`) | `25` |
| `BOT_NAME`, `BOT_PREFIX`, `OWNER_NAME` | Identity | `TEDDY-XMD`, `.`, `Teddy Tech` |
| `PORT` | Health/status web server | `3000` |
| `MENU_IMAGE_URL` | Header image when `.setmenuimage on` | built-in |
| `BOT_FORWARDED_TAG` | Cosmetic "Forwarded many times" label on `.ping` `.runtime` `.alive` `.botinfo` `.version` `.stats` `.sysinfo` `.botcore` (`off` hides it) | `on` |
| `BOT_NOTICE_LINE` | Optional plain-text line above `.ping`/`.runtime` | *(none)* |
| `MAX_AUDIO_MB`, `MAX_AUDIO_MINUTES`, `MAX_MEDIA_MB`, `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | Size limits | `40`, `20`, `50`, `15` |
| `DEV_NUMBERS` | Digits-only numbers allowed to use the `$` dev shortcut | *(empty)* |
| `ENABLE_EVAL` | Enables `.eval` (arbitrary code — owner only) | `false` |
| `UPDATE_REPO` / `UPDATE_BRANCH` | `owner/repo` that `.update` pulls from | *(unset → `.update` disabled)* |
| `AUTO_JOIN_GROUP` | Auto-join the project support group on first connect | `false` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `REMOVEBG_API_KEY`, `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` | Optional extra providers | – |

### API configuration

All Wolvarex calls go through one client (`lib/api/wolvarex.js`); it reads `WOLVAREX_API_KEY` from the environment, applies timeouts and one retry for transient failures, and strips the key from any log line or chat message.

| Command(s) | Endpoint(s) |
|---|---|
| `.play`, `.songs`, `.ytmp3dl` | `/music/ytmp3-search`, `/music/ytmp3-download` |
| `.flux`, `.imagine` | `/ai/tools/generate` (`.imagine` tries `/ai/image/dall-e` first) |
| `.translate` | `/ai/translate` (MyMemory fallback) |
| `.groqai`, `.gpt4`/`.gptdirect`, `.llamachat` | `/ai/groq`, `/ai/gpt`, `/ai/llama` |
| `.riddle .pickupline .quote .flirtline .joke .wouldrather .roast .fact .dare .truth .trivia` | `/fun/riddles`, `/fun/pickuplines`, `/fun/quotes`, `/fun/flirt`, `/fun/jokes`, `/fun/wouldyourather`, `/fun/roasts`, `/fun/funfacts`, `/fun/dares`, `/fun/truth`, `/fun/trivia` |
| `.imgbb`, `.catbox` | `/url/imgbb`, `/url/catbox` |
| `.videosearch` (`.search`) | `/search/videos` |
| `.ssweb` | `/tools/screenshot` |
| `.weather` | `/tools/weather` (wttr.in fallback) |
| `.instadl` | `/download/instagram/igram` |
| `.giftovideo .stickertoimg .stickertovideo .videotogif .videotosticker` | `/converter/*` |

> The Wolvarex API is not publicly documented. Response parsing is deliberately tolerant (`lib/api/normalize.js`), and when a response can't be understood the *key structure only* is written to the server log so the mapping can be adjusted.

## Local development

```bash
npm run check           # syntax-check every file
npm run audit:imports   # missing files / undeclared packages
npm test                # unit tests (mocked network, no WhatsApp needed)
npm run verify          # all of the above
npm run dev             # restart on file changes
```

Project layout:

```
commands/<category>/   one file per command (folder = menu category)
lib/api/               Wolvarex client + music / ai / fun / tools / upload / social / convert
lib/menu/              menu model, 6 views, 8 styles, ads
lib/plugins/           fault-tolerant loader (+ live reload)
lib/helpers/           reply, media, image processing, AFK, factories
lib/utils/             errors, redact, logger, http, SSRF guard, safe paths
config/                environment-driven configuration
deployment/            entrypoint, Koyeb spec, panel/troubleshooting guides
tests/                 node:test suites
```

## Deployment

### Docker

```bash
cp .env.example .env         # fill in WOLVAREX_API_KEY (SESSION_ID optional — pair via the web page instead)
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f
```

The image runs the bot as the unprivileged `node` user (via `gosu` after fixing volume permissions), forwards `SIGTERM/SIGINT` with `tini` for a graceful shutdown, and exposes `/health` (also `/healthz`) plus the pairing page at `/` for health checks and adding sessions. Keep `/app/sessions`, `/app/session` and `/app/data` on volumes (compose does this).

### Fly.io

```bash
fly launch --no-deploy --copy-config      # choose your own app name and region
fly volumes create teddy_xmd_data --size 1   # same region as the app
fly secrets set WOLVAREX_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"  # SESSION_ID optional — pair via the web page instead
fly deploy
```

`fly.toml` mounts one volume at `/persist`; the entrypoint keeps `data/` and `session/` on it. Machines never auto-stop, so the bot stays connected.

### Koyeb

Create a **Web Service** from your Git repo with the **Dockerfile** builder, port `3000` (HTTP), health check path `/health`, and add `WOLVAREX_API_KEY` as a secret. `deployment/koyeb.yaml` lists the same settings for the CLI. The free tier has no persistent volume — pairing (or `SESSION_ID`) won't survive a redeploy there.

### Render, Railway, Heroku-style hosts, VPS, panels

Any host that runs `npm install && npm start` works: set the environment variables above, expose `PORT`, and use `/health` as the health check. `render.yaml` and `Procfile` are included; see `deployment/DEPLOY-PANEL.md` for Pterodactyl panels. Use pm2/systemd on a VPS.

## Security notes

- **Rotate any API key that was ever committed or shared.** The archive this release was cleaned from shipped a `.env` containing an API key; it has been removed and `.env` is now git-ignored, but the old key must be considered exposed.
- Secrets are read only from the environment. Outgoing chat messages and logs are passed through a redactor that removes configured secrets, `key=`/`token=` values, bearer tokens and server paths.
- User- or API-supplied URLs go through an SSRF guard: http(s) only, ports 80/443, no credentials, DNS results must be public addresses, redirects are re-validated hop by hop.
- Privileged commands: `.eval`, `.update`, `.restart`, `.shutdown`, `.leaveall`, `.join`, `.gitclone`, `.forwardmsg`, `.factoryreset`, `.setowner`, `.resetowner`, `.addwhitelist`, `.removewhitelist` and **every DEV command** are **owner-only — sudo users are not enough**. `.cat/.ls/.download` cannot touch `.env`, `session/`, `owner.json`, `.git`, `node_modules` or symlinks pointing outside the project.
- The `$` dev shortcut only works for numbers listed in `DEV_NUMBERS` (empty by default).
- `AUTO_JOIN_GROUP` is off unless you opt in.
- Known limit: DNS is resolved by the SSRF guard and again by the HTTP client, so a hostile DNS server could still race the check.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| API commands missing from `.menu` | `WOLVAREX_API_KEY` is not set (owners still see them flagged ⚠️). Run `.devcheck`. |
| `.play` says "Request failed" | Check the server log (`LOG_LEVEL=debug` shows the response *shape*). Try `.songs <name>` to see the search step alone. |
| `.setbotpp` says image processing is unavailable | The host can't load `sharp` (common on Termux/Alpine/panels). Run `npm install sharp jimp` (or `npm rebuild sharp`), or install `ffmpeg`. `.devcheck` shows which backends load. |
| `npm install` fails on a panel | See `deployment/DEPLOY_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`. |
| Bot exits at start with "No SESSION_ID" | You're running `node index.js` directly (`npm run single`) with no terminal and no `SESSION_ID` set — either set `SESSION_ID`, or use `npm start` (`node sessions.js`) instead, which pairs over the web page and never needs one. |
| Health page shows `"connected":false` and `"plugins":0` forever | Same cause as above under a panel's pseudo-console (Pterodactyl etc.) — it's stuck at an interactive prompt nobody is answering. Switch the startup command to `node sessions.js` and use its pairing page. |
| A command doesn't appear | `.plugins failed` lists files that failed to load and why. `.reloadplugins` re-scans without a restart. |

## Telegram WhatsApp Pairing Bot

The Telegram bot requests WhatsApp pairing codes directly from the main TEDDY-XMD sessions server (`/api/pair`). It does not use a session ID and does not require the separate `session-generator` service.

### Environment variables

- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` — token created with Telegram's official @BotFather. Keep it secret.
- `PAIRING_API_URL` — base URL of the running main TEDDY-XMD sessions server (default `http://127.0.0.1:3000`). Set this to the public/internal URL of the server when the Telegram bot runs separately.
- `PORT` — port used by the main sessions server if it differs from `3000`.

### Run

1. Start the main TEDDY-XMD server with `npm start` (this serves the website and `/api/pair`).
2. Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` and, if the Telegram bot runs separately, `PAIRING_API_URL`.
3. Start the Telegram bot with `npm run telegram-pairing` in a second process/container.
4. In Telegram, send `/start`, then `/pair 254712345678` using your WhatsApp number with country code and digits only.

The pairing code is returned directly in Telegram. The Telegram bot does not display or require a session ID. Keep the bot token and pairing codes private. Payment gating is not implemented by this Telegram pairing script yet; integrate Paystack verification before using paid access.

## Paystack payments (KSh 30 per pairing)

The pairing website and Telegram pairing bot share Paystack payment verification. Each successful payment must be exactly **KES 30** and unlocks one pairing attempt. A payment grant is marked used after the pairing request succeeds. Refreshing the website clears the in-memory access token, so the user starts again at checkout.

### Configure

Set these variables in your hosting provider's server-side environment settings (or copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local development):

- `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` — your Paystack **secret** key. Keep it private; do not put it in HTML or share it in chat. Use a test secret key while testing, then switch to a live key after testing.
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` — token from Telegram `@BotFather`.
- `PAIRING_API_URL` — base URL of the same TEDDY-XMD sessions server, e.g. `https://your-server.example` when Telegram runs as a separate process.
- `PAYSTACK_CALLBACK_URL` — optional; defaults to the origin that starts checkout plus `/?payment=return`.

The server stores payment references and one-use grants in `data/paystack-payments.json`. On hosts with ephemeral filesystems, attach persistent storage for the `data/` directory or payment grants may be lost on restart.

### Website flow

1. Open the pairing website and press **Pay KSh 30 with Paystack**.
2. Enter an email for the Paystack receipt and complete checkout.
3. On return, the server verifies the transaction directly with Paystack, including success status, KES currency, exact amount, and reference.
4. The pairing form unlocks for one pairing request. Refreshing resets the page to the payment step.

### Telegram flow

Start the Telegram process with `npm run telegram-pairing`, while the main server is running. In Telegram use:

1. `/start`
2. `/pay you@example.com`
3. Complete the Paystack checkout.
4. Send `/verify YOUR_PAYSTACK_REFERENCE`
5. Send `/pair 254712345678`

Telegram and website must point to the same main server so they share the same payment records. Never trust a screenshot or a user claim of payment; only the server-side Paystack verification unlocks pairing.
